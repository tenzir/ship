Lets you export individual entries to JSON or Markdown without targeting a full release, and you can pass multiple identifiers to gather a curated bundle of changes in any format. Release manifests are now selected by passing their version (for example, `v1.0.0`) instead of the removed `--release` flag, and the table view no longer exposes the unused `--since` filter.
