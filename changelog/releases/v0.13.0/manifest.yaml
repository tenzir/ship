title: Tenzir Changelog v0.13.0
intro: >-
  This release streamlines module mode by removing the multi-project feature in favor
  of the dedicated `modules` configuration. It removes the `--include-modules` flag
  (modules are now always included when configured) and enhances module mode to show
  released entries with version numbers. The release notes command now defaults to
  the latest release when no identifier is provided. Additionally, YAML frontmatter
  generation and error messages have been improved for better developer experience.
