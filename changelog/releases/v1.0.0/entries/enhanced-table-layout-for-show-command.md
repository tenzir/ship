The title column now expands to fill available terminal width, ensuring optimal use of screen space. Component labels appear inline after the title in a dimmed green style, replacing the separate component column. The column order has been adjusted to show PR numbers before the entry type, and the column header changed from "PRs" to "PR". Empty PR values display as a dimmed dash for visual consistency.
