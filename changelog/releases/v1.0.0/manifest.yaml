title: Ship Relaunch
intro: >-
  This major release renames the package from `tenzir-changelog` to `tenzir-ship`
  and introduces several breaking changes to streamline the CLI interface. The `show`
  command now uses intuitive positional tokens (`unreleased`, `released`, `latest`,
  `all`) instead of flags, and the `release notes` command has been merged into `show
  --release`. A new `stats` command provides adaptive project statistics, and the
  table layout has been enhanced with better title formatting and inline component
  labels.
